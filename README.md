# AB-Testing-Udacity-Project

## Project Description 
This project is about A/B testing experiment conducted by Udacity, an e-learning platform. The experimental change done in this test is to trigger a screen which displays a message asking weekly time users can commit once they clicked on the  free-trial button. If the input value is less than 5, a message would appear mentioning ' Udacity courses take greater time commitment for successful completion and its suggests students might like to access the course material for free'.

 ## Project Goal 
The goal of conducting the A/B test with new experimental change is to reduce the number of users who leave the course at the end of the free-trial period by directing them to use free course materials while increase the retention after 14 days free trial period, by encouraging users only with enough time commitement to enrolled into free-trial plan.
